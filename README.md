# hobbyfarm

This repo contains a Helm chart for deploying hobbyfarm as well as [documentation](https://boxboat.github.io/hobbyfarm) on using the platform.

There is a GitHub Actions [Workflow](https://github.com/boxboat/hobbyfarm/actions?query=workflow%3A%22publish+chart%22) that will publish a new version of the chart (to GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/boxboat/hobbyfarm/releases)) if the `version` in `charts/hobbyfarm/Chart.yaml` is bumped.
